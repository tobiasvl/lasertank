Laser Tank is HelpWare. You can use Laser Tank for free, but like all free things there is a catch. I want you to make a new level, using the Level Editor, and send it to me. I will update the software every now and then and add all the good levels that are sent to me. See  "Writing your own levels" in the help file.

You can E-mail me the file at :
   lasertank@pacbell.net
