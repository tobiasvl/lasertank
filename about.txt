   LaserTank is HelpWare and you can use it for free.

   After you became a skilled player, maybe you will want 
to make one or more new levels, using the Level Editor, 
and send them to us, with your playback (LPB files). 
We will update the software every now and then and add all 
the good levels that are sent. See  "Writing your own levels" 
and "Recording & Playback" in the help file.

  (Please, be inventive and do try not to replicate what is already existing).

  (There is already so many levels available on the LaserTank WEB site).

   If you beat any of the High Scores, make sure you have the most recent Global High Score file, send a zip file with the playbacks for the levels you beat and your LaserTank.hs file.

   You can e-mail the file's to : lasertank@globetrotter.net

   For more levels, Graphics files, & the most recent Global High Score file check out the LaserTanks WEB site :
