LaserTank is HelpWare.
You can use LaserTank for free, but like all free things there is a catch. We want you to make a new level, using the Level Editor, and send it to us, with your playback (LPB file). We will update the software every now and then and add all the good levels that are sent. See  "Writing your own levels" and "Recording & Playback" in the help file.

If you beat any of the High Scores, make sure you have the most recent Global High Score file, send a zip file with the playbacks for the levels you beat and your LaserTank.hs file.

You can e-mail the file's to: lasertank@globetrotter.net
