LaserTank
=========

This is a mirror of the source code of the computer puzzle game LaserTank by Jim Kindley.

LaserTank was originally created by Jim in 1995. Starting with version 3.1 in 2000, Jim released the game and source code into the public domain.

I have downloaded the different source code releases from the LaserTank website on Internet Archive's Wayback Machine, and combined them into this Git repository.

In addition, I have compiled Jim's different changelogs from this repo and the website into the `CHANGELOG` file, and added a `LICENSE` file to formalize its release into the public domain.

For reference, the license boilerplates Jim Kindley added to the source code are as follows:

```
